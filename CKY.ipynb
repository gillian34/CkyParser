Once the tables are filled, it calls a method called backtracking to recursively follow the pointers and find the parse of the phrase or sentence."

I first called the parse_table method to fill in all possible parses into a table and then I traversed the table from the top right cell to find the longest partial parse by looking at the cells that account for the most amount of words. Then, I called the backpointer method recursively to get a parse for the partial sentence. Then I recursively called my solution on the rest of the sentence (both sides that aren't acocunted for by the parse) The first parse in the list is the longest partial parse. If a sentence parses completely, I simply printed out the parse"

        "**My Solution:** To fix the grammar, I realized that these sentences have three problems. The first one needs to account for singular and plural differences. The second one needs to account for the fact that some verbs are transitive and only take one argument. The third sentence needs the rules to account for the fact that some verbs are ditransitive and take two arguements.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these needs, I assigned all N, NBar, and NP as singular or plural. I then assigned all revelent verbs as singular or plural as well. Then, I assigned the verbs as transitive or ditransitive. This made me have a lot more terminals in my rule list. Because of this, I now had to change all the subsequent rules so that Ns, NBars, and NPs were only matching up with Vs and VPs that had the same plurality as them. I also changed all subsequent rules so that V, and VP would only take the relevent amount of arguments. To do this, I needed to specify whether an NP had two arguments or one, which affected the VPs that it was allowed to combine with. In my results, it is clear that the partial parses couldn't combine with each other because of the reasons listed above."
