# CkyParser

This git repository contains code to create a CKY parser. The program reads in a file containing context free grammar rules, reads sentences and produces parse trees for the sentences based on the grammar rules. If there are multiple possible parses, the program outputs all possibilities. 

This project was created for a Princeton class titled "Introduction to Machine Translation."
